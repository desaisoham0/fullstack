# Full-Stack Application

## Project Overview

I created this project to enhance my understanding of full-stack development by integrating various technologies and tools. Below is a summary of what I learned and implemented:

- **Front-end Development with React**: Developed a dynamic and responsive user interface using React, focusing on component-based architecture and state management.

- **Backend Development with Node.js and Express**: Built a robust server using Node.js and Express, handling API requests, routing, and middleware.

- **Data Storage with MongoDB**: Implemented MongoDB as the database to efficiently store and manage application data, using Mongoose for object data modeling.

- **User Authentication with Firebase**: Integrated Firebase Authentication to secure the application, allowing users to sign up, log in, and manage their sessions.

- **Connecting Frontend and Backend with Axios**: Utilized the axios library to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring smooth data exchange via HTTP requests.

- **Hosting on Google Cloud**: Deployed the full-stack application on Google Cloud, ensuring scalability, security, and high availability.
